# moodle-lifecycle-lastaccesstrigger

[WIP] This is a trigger-subplugin for the admin tool [moodle-tool_lifecycle](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle). 
It simply triggers courses which haven't been accessed (by enrolled users) since a configurable delay.

## Settings
Site administrator sets delay (in various time units).  

## More information  
For detailed information on trigger plugins visit the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle/wiki) of the moodle-tool_lifecycle admin tool.
